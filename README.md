In Even and Odd program,this program prompts the user to enter an integer. It then uses an if-else statement to determine whether the number is even or odd. A number is even if it is divisible by 2 without a remainder (i.e., number % 2 == 0), otherwise, it is odd.
In Sum of Integer program,this program uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50 and calculates the sum of all these integers. It keeps a running total in a variable and prints the final result after the loop ends.
